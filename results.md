We have processed all the submissions and resolved all the contentions we received. A few clarifications:
* As stated in the email and on the website, even though all the levels' problem sets were revealed, all the rules of the event have been upheld. This means that any submissions of the questions above the level at which the team was at the time of submission have been rejected. 
* Marking is based on the timestamp of each submission (which we have to the precision of a second). The only exception made is for the initial submissions which we asked to resubmit, due to permission issues with the document uploaded. For them we have considered the timestamp of the original submission and not the timestamp of the resubmitted submission. Most of the accepted resubmissions were within a few minutes of the original submission.
